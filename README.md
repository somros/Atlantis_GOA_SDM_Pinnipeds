# Pinnipeds_GOA

This code creates spatial distributions of harbor seals and northern fur seals for Atlantis GOA. These two species are part of the "Pinnipeds" functional group in Atlantis GOA. Harbor seals were captured with colony counts for 2018 from Alaska (AFSC), and for British Columbia with data from [CRIMS - DFO](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/55a0f2d6-b035-4783-ad5d-1a213fd01ed3).  

Northern fur seals do not haul out in the GOA, so no count data are available. We estimate their relative distributions with heuristics (abundance from stock assessment and generic distribution along the continental shelf).
